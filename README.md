# "Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious" :roll_eyes:

The second project as you enter Hive - 42, is to make get_next_line. Which main function is, as name suggested, getting the next line.
Your function will read the text file pointed by the file descriptor one line at a time.
This project introduce a new concept: static variable.

I will add a diagram that I drew myself when first attempting this project. Hopefully it helps you in formulating your thoughts in accordance to the school's requirements.

My function passes gnl test on both mandatory and bonus parts. Gnl Tester provided by https://github.com/Tripouille

To test for yourself, copy the following block of code onto terminal

**Test mandatory part only**
````
git clone https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester.git
cd gnlTester
make m
````
**Test bonus part only**
````
git clone https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester.git
cd gnlTester
make b
````
**Test both mandatory and bonus part**
````
git clone https://github.com/Tripouille/gnlTester.git
cd gnlTester
make
````

22 November 2022, I validated the project with bonus points scored.

As part of the achievement hunt, came the first project that I validated with maximum score.

As a side note, it is recommended to skip bonus parts if you are somewhat worried about blackhole (new curriculum students will know). I personally only attempted the bonus part because it is rather easy, and also for the achievement.
